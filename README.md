# Implement-decision-tree-algorithm-using-sklearn-python-
Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
So using sklearn i personally analyse decision tree algorithm on diabetes data set which is very powerful algorithm used for classification and to make relationship between dependent and independent variables.
